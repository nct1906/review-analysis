"Drew of Memphis, TN","Original review: Sept. 21, 2021","I recently placed a large order with West Elm, including a few large rugs. I received a shipment delivered email for one rug, but no rug. Once I checked the tracking from UPS, I could see that UPS reported the package as damaged during transit, and returned it to West Elm's warehouse where it was signed for as delivered, not my residence. No one from West Elm contacted me or otherwise seemed to notice my rug was delivered back to them for a week before I contacted them. I waited on hold for a long time and eventually spoke to a nice man named Chris who apologized. Chris assured me another rug would be sent. He even gave me a confirmation number. No rug was sent. After another 3 weeks, I decided to chargeback the cost of the rug and buy elsewhere rather than go through West Elm customer service again.",1.0

"Malcolm of Severna Park, MD","Resolution response: Oct. 16, 2021",Through a series of unfortunate events this was finally taken care of and we have been compensated and have the furniture intact. There were missing pieces and upon initial delivery the sofa was shipped with 2 left arms. That took another month to correct. Highly recommend West Elm devise a process that validates pieces are shipped accurately and those that continue to delay to ship a person actually look into why. We waited 3 months initially before I got angry and turns out the furniture was delayed just because of an unnecessary mattress that goes into the pullout drawer. West Elm was unaware of why it was delayed until I called numerous times.,1.0
"Andrew of Minneapolis, MN","Original review: Sept. 16, 2021","Worst delivery experience I've ever had. Delivery was a complete mess and my item never arrived. Waited over three months and spent hours on the phone with West Elm and their delivery service Ryder. They could not fix the issue and every time they said it was scheduled for delivery I would get a last minute cancellation with no explanation or follow up from anyone. Don't waste your time, over priced furniture that never arrives is worse than worthless. Would give zero stars if possible.",1.0
"Y of Lafayette, CA","Original review: Sept. 15, 2021","Ordered a coffee table that arrived damaged. The credit they offered was minimal compared to the table one would expect when you pay nearly $600 for a table plus shipping. Clearly they have no accountability for delivering high quality products and are OK with delivering damaged ones. They “offered” I send it back for a refund but the time required and pain of disassembling and sending it back is something they obviously know one wouldn’t do. On top of that the credit they send you is delivered via USPS, delaying things even further. This is terrible customer service, poor quality control, and an archaic way of doing business. Many other options with much better customer service out there. A truly disappointing experience given this is the second large purchase I made from them that arrived damaged. I’d never buy furniture from them again and really suggest you look elsewhere as well.",1.0
"Amy of Coeur D Alene, ID","Original review: Sept. 14, 2021","I am finally writing this review after not just one, but multiple terrible experiences with ordering from West Elm (as well as from sister company, Pottery Barn). Both companies offer beautiful goods, however the sales tactics will prevent me from EVER ordering from West Elm again. West Elm will list an item as “in stock”—-do not believe it. The last THREE items I ordered (an area rug, mirrors and a vase) all said “in stock” and/or had a very near delivery date, so I placed the orders. West Elm then simply does not deliver, provides NO email updates, necessitating that the customer call and wait on hold to inquire about the order. Automated delivery dates are provided which mean nothing. After many years of being a dedicated customer, I am closing my account. The frustration is not worth dealing with this company or its sister companies.",1.0
"Joan of Burbank, CA","Original review: Sept. 7, 2021","The look of West Elm's furniture is beautiful. And for the price of their products, I was expecting good to high quality. Unfortunately, this is not the case. I purchased a Streamline Coffee Table. It took months to come in, but I wasn't upset about that due to several companies having inventory issues since Covid started. But when the table arrived, the light-colored, wood top was nicked, scratched and had a black mark on it. I called to have the top replaced. They said no problem, and they would pick up the old top and bring a new one in 3-4 weeks. I waited and waited and come 6 weeks later, I still didn't hear anything. So, I call again, and they said it was ready, and they just need to schedule the delivery. I told them I never received any notification that the replacement was ready to be delivered, and the lady got snippy with me and gave me some excuse I didn't understand. But in the end, we scheduled a day for the exchange.",1.0

We waited 5 months for this couch, it came with a defective cushion so we placed an order for a replacement cushion… The Moss color fabric “ran out” so we did a full couch replacement in Petrol and the supplier I emailed said she put in a new order. I looked it up on the West Elm website and it showed up. That fabric supposedly “ran out” too so they CANCELLED IT without telling me. I would’ve been waiting for weeks for a couch that doesn’t exist. They said our only option was to place a new order (and pay $3000) for a new couch instead of replacing the one ($2000) they sent to us messed up. We ordered this back in March when they had their sale, BIG MISTAKE. Going to just see if an upholsterer can fix their shoddy work. We just wanted a new cushion!!!",1.0
"Amanda of Arlington, VA","Original review: Sept. 7, 2021",The Frame extension table is an absolute nightmare to insert and remove the extension leaf. It is not fit for purpose. We purchased with the idea of using as a  four person table day to day and then extending as need. This is so difficult. You need two people and you have to remove hardware each time. It is the most impractical table. I guess that’s why the store display is fully set for dinner so you can’t test in shop. White glove people installed at the expanded length screws it all in and left without showing us how to reduce and took the hardware with them.,1.0

Lo and behold, even up to the day before my delivery I received emails confirming my delivery, only to receive a call that same day stating the delivery was canceled.

"Maria of Little Neck, NY","Original review: Sept. 3, 2021","Terrible Terrible. We ordered the Andes Sectional which took four months to make. When we finally got delivery, the ottoman to the sectional went missing in the warehouse. So they delivered a partial sectional. AND then, the screws were missing to the legs of the sectional. When they shipped us the new screws, they were the wrong size screws. I have never encountered such bad service and they were not even apologetic for any of this incompetence. To date, we are STILL waiting for the right screws and our ottoman is lost somewhere in the warehouse. This is not a cheap sectional - we paid $5,000 for this.

"Roshan of San Jose, CA","Original review: Aug. 26, 2021","We had ordered a rug online for a good price point. There were ads seen at that price point and also article on CNN mentioning the reduced price. We went ahead and ordered few items. They delivered the regular priced item on time and sent an email stating cannot fill the order on rug. Spoke to the customer rep and asked for details, they mentioned that it was a pricing error on their part. They were willing to offer a discount. After the discount the price was still 4 times the price we initially ordered it for. This is how they lure you in, click bait on ads and fancy articles on CNN on discounts and ultimately when it is time to full-fill order, only fulfill those from which they have high profitability and fool the customer.

Butler tray, nightstand, media console, sofa, coffee table and sheet set all took forever to get here and when they did they were either missing half the item, lost or damaged from not only the warehouse but from the awful shipping company that is Ryder last mile. Oh and not to mention that media console I waited so long for was tagged as the completely wrong item and shipped.

When I went for a visit recently I was embarrassed to learn that 3 buttons broke in half (and were sharp to touch) and there was a large tear in the seam. The duvet cover was on sale for $180 (so no small change!). I contacted customer service and they took no responsibility for the issue. They said I should have noticed the issue within their 30 days return time, even though I explained to them the duvet was hardly used. They offered me 10% compensation. A laughable offer. I don't know how they can possibly think a duvet cover should be expected to last 5 uses?!!? I didn't ask for a refund. I asked for a replacement duvet but perhaps they know the next duvet won't last any longer?!? A very disappointing response from a company like West Elm.

The only catch was that they had to pick the sofa up---no big deal, except there were some issues with the local hub's delivery system and we had some appointments for pickup cancelled by the computer system. I was frustrated by this, and Charlene and Tammi gave us an additional gift card as compensation for the inconveniences. I won't buy another West Elm sofa, BUT I will be happy to use the merchandise credits in some other way. Super pleased with the care the social media team gave to my complaint.",
"Victoria of Lynn, MA","Original review: July 3, 2021","West Elm has the worst delivery service I’ve ever dealt with. I am beyond angry as I was supposed to get my couch delivered today. The driver called me complaining about parking, then called me back asking me to open the door. I told him to ring the doorbell, and there was an elevator that would directly take him up. My boyfriend got surgery, and I had to step out. The driver said it was fine. The driver rang the doorbell, and my boyfriend unlocked the door. The driver held something up on the door, seemingly to deliver my furniture. I get a notification and email saying my furniture was delivered. Guess what, it wasn’t!!! ",1.0

This company wasted so much money sending me the wrong item and having pay for return shipping. No wonder there are so many complaints. Thank goodness, my purchase was a small one.

The clips that were to attach the pieces were not installed correctly, and the delivery men tried to jam them in so now both clips are are bent and our couches cannot be connected. They did not have the tools to fix it. They told us that they would have someone out in 3 days. That was last week. We now have a date 2 weeks from delivery. Our old couches are at the dump, and my party I had planned was moved. We were given lip service when we called numerous times getting the run around and told someone would reach out. We have also sent numerous emails with pictures attached, and not received a call. We paid enough to get a quality sectional.

The company ""reached out"" to ask me to email them at a generic email with all of my details. This allows it to display as in resolution or something like that on this site which makes West Elm look super responsive to customer complaints. Actually, it is the furthest thing from being responsive to customer complaints. I responded to this post with the order number and information and no one responded back. They must scour these boards to give generic responses putting all the onus on the consumer to look responsive without actually doing any work to resolve the customer issues.

"Lynne of Atlanta, GA","Original review: April 13, 2021","After contacting a customer service rep about the standing lamp I purchased on line that came with a different shade than advertised, I thought a shipping mistake had been made. I was sent a replacement and again it was incorrect. Not, not the displayed shade that was a big part of the lamp's ""impact"" and buy ability was no longer offered with the lamp. The shade was now being sold with a different standing lamp. I insisted they switch out the shade as as advertised with the lamp I had bought. The rep agreed to this. She could not get this done so after many days I offered to buy a shade from elsewhere that suited the lamp and get reimbursed to save time and effort. She gratefully agreed to this. ",1.0

"Sarah Jane of Sunnyside, NY","Original review: April 10, 2021","I understand West Elm’s policy to not cancel custom build furniture. But there needs to be a time limit. They keep pushing back the date and cannot promise me when it will be done. They claim the build is “in progress.” But they also claim they don’t have the materials they need. (Note that plenty of reviews similar to mine are pre-pandemic. It’s a West Elm problem, not a pandemic problem.) If they keep pushing back the date, and they don’t have the materials, the build is clearly NOT IN PROGRESS. Therefore, a refund should be allowed so I can buy a glider elsewhere. By the time I get this stupid glider, I won’t need a glider. STAY AWAY from this company. It’s not worth it.

Every time I contact West Elm it is a different person to reply and a different response depending on the person.

After calling, I was told there was nothing they could do and that they'd likely run out of the fabric. The fabric was available at the time of my purchase and I was not offered any other options. Instead, they just canceled. Now I haven't had a couch for months and will likely have to wait even longer to get one elsewhere. Terrible customer service. Terribly run as a business. DON'T TRUST THEM. Buy elsewhere.",1.0

We had moved into a new house so literally had no couch for this entire time. ,1.0
"Erin of Johns Island, SC","Original review: Jan. 20, 2021","I lusted after West Elm furniture for years so I saved for over a year to purchase what I thought was an investment in a quality sleeper sofa for ~$3000. Cue light to average use for about 1 year and the sofa is horribly misshapen by the attached back cushions and the seat cushions are so deflated you can feel the metal of the sleeper sofa components beneath you. Sitting on the ground is actually more comfortable. The sofa (Henry sleeper with chaise) is no longer manufactured - and is it any wonder? I have been ""offered"" a plethora of solutions from replacing the cushions (turns out not an option for a product no longer manufactured) to paying out of pocket to repair to a measly merchandise credit for a fraction of the cost.",

I also want to acknowledge that I understand COVID has pushed back a lot of orders but it’s been 6 months now since I ordered my sofa and dining table. I had to call more than 10 times after my delivery date got pushed to get someone to send me my sofa without waiting for the dining table, since the dining table wasn’t ready still and my sofa was just sitting in the warehouse for months. I finally got my sofa last week. It had a strong smell of warehouse that I cant’ get out.

We first picked our couch 3 months ago after going to the store. The first inkling that they have no idea what they’re doing was when their online site, customer service, and in-store sales people gave completely different answers on materials available, prices, and delivery times for the exact same sofa. After fumbling around, they were finally able to place the order for us which apparently was during some sale event (important later). Being in an apartment building, it was critical that we get this couch delivery done smoothly so we communicated that with them and went with the “white-glove delivery”. Apparently, a misnomer.",1.0

We were just going to do it online but wanted to support the local store. We both bought quite a bit of furniture and my Mom bought the Harris sectional with a custom fabric. The associate who helped us was great in finding one that would fit her room and we bought it in pieces (modular). However, what she wanted was a chase in one side and a terminal chase in the other. What he put together was a terminal chase on one side and a normal couch end on the other, with an ottoman to act as a chase. We were a little rushed at the store because they were about to close.

Upon delivery, I received a Dual Tone Sofa! The sofa arm was a completely different shade of gray than the chaise! It looked completely mismatched. How does that get past quality control?

After weeks of bumped delivery dates, a small army of unhelpful and excuse laden customer service staff, we STILL DON'T have our purchase, whose delivery has once again been bumped (this time by a whole week)! Every institution has its bad eggs, but West Elm's regular condescension, menagerie of excuse, misinformation, or lying (in the case of its third party delivery service) was beyond the pale. Even in the few (rare) instances someone made an effort or promise of help, such action we not (functionally) followed through on by the company.

On the delivery date, we received a call saying it would not be delivered that day because part of it was not available. So the delivery was cancelled. Then later that same day, delivery guys show up with one part of the bed. Apparently only part of the delivery was cancelled. Logistics is not West Elm's strong suit. They left an enormous box in our living room that's been sitting there for over a month. The second part of the delivery was supposed to be by mid May. It's now the end of May and still nothing.

I was looking for a simple white duvet, and this one looked gorgeous on the website. While the website does not have reviews, it was recommended in a New York Magazine article so I thought that it would be good. I received the duvet and was instantly disappointed. While the top of the duvet is thick and nice, the underside definitely has a lower thread count, is cheap feeling, and VERY thin. I kept it because I didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it and the top part definitely looks nice. Now I have the reoccurring problem of weird yellow/tan stains showing up after every time I wash it. ",1.0

At one side of the arm, several joints were protruding out and not flush. Clearly an issue with how the frame was made. Dealing with WestElm is a nightmare. Be prepared to have them stronghold you on your purchase and leave you bitter. On top of this their 3rd party delivery company Ryder scratched some walls from their so-called ""White Glove"" service and WestElm has shown no sign of accountability. There are way better companies out there. DO NOT RECOMMEND.",1.0
"Aneta of Aurora, ON","Original review: Nov. 30, 2019",So I ordered a duvet cover on Sept. 5th from West Elm. This was my first purchase from them and a bit of a splurge. I was pretty excited to about it. About 2 weeks later I received a package but when I opened it there was no duvet cover only a change pad cover and a slipcover for a breast feeding pillow. Ok... So I called right away and turns out they had messed up the order and would send a replacement right away. In the meantime there was a price drop of over $100 so I thought it would be worthwhile to order the less expensive one and return the more expensive replacement one because of course this is the one company that doesn’t do price adjustments. So I receive both duvet covers around the same time. ,1.0

On the back of each frame, the two hooks to hang the frame on the wall are not aligned horizontally or vertically. Therefore, in order to properly measure to hang them, you have to measure each hook separately. Also the template they provided, would never work because of this reason and was not even the same size of the frame. Since all 6 were wrong, we didn't want to return them and get new ones because we were worried they would be wrong again. We went through the activity of measuring every single one. It took about 4 hours to hang 6 pictures!",2.0

It is shocking how absolutely atrocious their customer care is, especially in considering their furniture prices. I have had better customer service at IKEA and Structube. It is safe to say I will never be shopping at West Elm again. I like companies that actually care and value their customers. This is not one of them.",1.0
"Scott of Middleton, WI","Original review: Aug. 25, 2018","Purchased a dining table ($799.20) and bench ($319.20). Hadn't even shipped yet, and noticed a new promotional price, $600 for table and $240 for bench. After about 55 minutes on hold and 3 separate contacts, I finally spoke to someone and they said they couldn't do a price adjustment. I told them, I will literally return this if they don't honor the price adjustment. They didn't care to honor the $280 or so in price difference, so I just said ""cancel the order"", which they did. So, they lost a $1,118.40 sale over a $280 price adjustment, makes no sense! Oh well, we'll be looking elsewhere for a new table and bench! Come on West Elm, I thought you were better than that!",1.0

From day one the lower cushions slide out every time you sit on them causing the upper cushions to slump down. The sections do not fit together evenly and one side is higher in the rear than the other. The couch creaks every time you sit on it and the fabric has fuzzy lint like is 10 years old. My previous couch I had it for over a decade and it looked great, expect the normal wear and tear that’s why I wanted to replace it for something fun and fresh. The Henry couch looks ragged. I am so disappointed and not surprised to see similar complaints about West Elm products. I contacted West Elm and I have not heard from them yet. I am still hopeful they do the right thing.

"Leon of Windham, CT","Original review: June 4, 2018",I love the idea that is West Elm. The coordination of the furniture with the accessories makes it easy to put together a room that reflects my personal style. West Elm is one of those stores you go in and you feel right at home with the great associates that really go out their way to help you achieve the look you sometimes can't describe in words. But West Elm needs to lower their shipping prices because the merchandise is really quality but when you add in the shipping it sometimes becomes cost prohibitive.,5.0

Unfortunately my one star is based on the quality of the product I received and that didn’t change thus I kept the one star. Good luxurious cotton sheets shouldn’t feel like these did (I wouldn’t call these good cotton sheets at all), and advertising and selling them as such isn’t right.  I do thank the customer service for addressing my concerns and trying to make it better they were really nice and even offered a gift card (which I turned down) I want to thank them for their curtious efforts.",1.0

The clean style of furniture and displays in the store: gives the shopper several options as to where furniture can be used. The general feel of the store is warm and friendly. The customer service and attention to customer is very good. The store can feel a little crowded though. There can be a lot of items displayed in a very small area at times too. It can be a little difficult to see and get to all items. The pricing could be more competitive or offer more sales. Would also like to see the square footage of the stores a little larger.,5.0

I basically furnish offices for a living and have never had so many orders not work out as with West Elm. When that happens, which is getting more and more frequent, they seem to have no idea how to do anything unless they are babysat and checked in on the entire way through the order. Even then you may not receive what you ordered. And even then, when you've been left high and dry, you may still have to spend 20 minutes on the phone to get your credit card refunded. ",1.0
"Lana of Delray Beach, FL","Original review: Sept. 20, 2017","I placed the order for sofa on July 7th. I was advised: Available for delivery by: Sep 04 Sep 18. Sept 18th came and I still have not heard from West Elm. I only noticed my credit card being charged in the last week for the full amount. I called West Elm. First customer service rep couldn't help me, I was transferred and waited 23 min. Danille from furniture department answered and ""helped"" me (her extension **). I was offered a discount for inconvenience. I accepted the discount under condition if she would let me know the delivery date by Tuesday 19th (24hrs). Today is Wed. Sept 20th 16:03 EST and I called Danille 3 times so far, left VM and have not heard back. This is very unprofessional. I was informed our conversation in recorded which I am happy for as I will needed when disputing my charge with the credit card company. Do not order customer made sofa from West Elm!!!",1.0
"Leslie of Birmingham, AL","Original review: Sept. 12, 2017","I ordered a couch back in April (it is not September). I have been on the phone for over an hour trying to locate said couch. The first time they sent it and never scheduled the appointment. After waiting on hold forever I finally got in touch with someone who said it had been sitting in the warehouse and no one told me. So then I scheduled the appointment and after finding coverage for my working and waiting forever on the couch, the ""couch"" that arrived was actually a chair that I did not order. After several more calls and waiting I discovered that my couch was lost and they had to make another one, which they promised would be there by September. Well now it is September and I have no couch and once again I am sitting on the phone for over an hour trying to reach someone. Please NEVER order from here!!",1.0
"Kayla of Sand Springs, OK","Original review: Aug. 21, 2017","We just walked away from our first shopping experience with West Elm and it was a mega fail. This is especially bad because we were going to spend over $1300 on a chair. On 8/19, we initially ordered the Henry Power Recliner Chair in twill fabric for a 2-3 week delivery. Within 5 minutes we decided to go with the leather option instead. Since it was a weekend, we were told to wait until Monday for the 1st order to cancel then we could place the order for the leather chair, which was in stock locally. Monday afternoon we went to the store to complete our order and schedule a pickup of the chair. The sales clerk advised us there would be a price difference - we knew this because the tag in the store showed $1599 for the leather chair. HOWEVER, the clerk claimed it was a good time to buy because we were getting 30% off the price. The amount that was showing on her computer screen was not 30% off, it was 20%. ",1.0
"Cindy of Huntersville, NC","Original review: Aug. 11, 2017",My son was moving from NC to Dallas. He purchased a bed online from West Elm and was given a date the bed was to be shipped. After hearing no updates from West Elm he called them to check on the status of the order and was told the bed would now be shipped 3 weeks past the date he was originally told it would be shipped. He is now in Dallas without a bed for 3 more weeks. He asked to cancel the order so he could go somewhere locally to purchase a bed and was told that he could not cancel the order. He is now forced to try and cancel through his credit card company. DO NOT ORDER FROM WEST ELM.,1.0

This was a very expensive piece of furniture and I am at a loss for words about the lack of customer service and updates I have gotten from the delivery service West Elm uses and the people at West Elm as well. First, I was out of the country and provided an alternate number they can call upon arrival. They called MY cell phone claiming they could not reach me (received this message when I came back from my trip). While the person waiting for my delivery did not get notified at all.

"Louise of Greenwich, CT","Original review: June 28, 2017","When my step daughter took time from work to receive her sofa delivery it was too large to fit up the steps. The delivery person gave her the name of a company that will come for the next delivery, take the furniture apart, move it into place and reassemble. All of this was set up for June 22nd. I took the day away from what I was supposed to be doing to help her out. We received the 2 hour window the day before which I passed on to the ""furniture fitters"". 1-3pm. I waited at the apartment for the call saying they were 30 minutes away which I was also to pass on to the furniture fitters who were standing by. The call never came. At 2:30 I called West Elm and spoke to Amber in the furniture delivery department. She said that the computer had canceled the delivery and no one had noticed. She gave me another delivery date weeks away which I told her no one could do and that they would need to have it delivered within 7 days. ",1.0
"viviane of Cherry Hill, NJ","Original review: June 18, 2017","I purchased the sofa Quinn Sectional on May 30, 2016 for $1,474.38 and today (6/18/17) the plywood base of the sofa detached from the staples. We were unable to place the plywood back to attachment piece to hammer with nails. The material inside the sofa is cheap (compressed wood chip held together by staples). Hammering the cheap wood with nails would destroy the compressed plywood piece. My husband and I work 15 hours days. The only time we lay on the sofa is at night to watch some TV before going to bed. I have no children and no visitors because we work too much to have time to socialize. But, I like nice things; Therefore, I trusted West Elm website to buy the sofa. Big Mistake.

"K. of Brooklyn, NY","Resolution response: June 10, 2017","When I never received the merchandise I ordered, I tracked the shipping and saw the items had been returned the West Elm warehouse.  (Of course no one from the company had reached out to tell me what was happening.)  I sent a message to customer service (this time in writing - having learned from my previous experience) and they responded that they were refunding my card for the cost of the goods (including the ""non-refundable items"") and giving me a gift card for the shipping cost.  I think the outcome is a reasonable compromise, although I'm dissatisfied overall with the experience because it was a lot of unnecessary time and headache to get to this point which could have been offered at the get-go.  Now I'm left with this bad taste for the whole family of brands and dread having to interact with customer service again.  Then again, a $50 gift card doesn't buy much at West Elm so I will probably end up spending more money there (which I guess is the whole point).",
"Andrea of Menlo Park, CA","Original review: April 29, 2017","I bought this rug recently from West Elm, but >30 days ago so I am unable to return. I have emailed West Elm 3x in the past month and sent pictures of a warped rug. The rug has not been exposed to moisture or even had much traffic on it, so it is puzzling why it is warping. I have not heard back anything, despite the claim that you will hear back from customer service within 48 hr. I have been reading other complaints that their products are not high quality and based on this experience it does not make sense to me to purchase anything from them in the future.",1.0

Went to the store to try to order glass replaced globe that broke while GENTLY cleaning.

After a few back and forth I was told they do not sell replacement parts, they buy them from a 3rd party vendor. I asked how to contact them, their cold response was to get on my server and try to find one. This is ridiculous!

The problems are; 1. They do not track the history of the communications with customer. That means I need to explain once again if person in charge is changed. 2. It took time to check the latest product information. The bed I looked at website became sale, but they insisted old price for the bed. 3.

"Julie of Fort Wayne, IN","Original review: Feb. 4, 2017","I'd had my eye on a foyer light fixture and kept waiting for it to go on sale. It finally did at the same time they offered free shipping so I ordered it. It arrived within days in perfect condition. It's gorgeous! The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is maybe really my own issue: the pictures never showed how the light attaches to the ceiling. It arrived with a wiring kit so the fixture could be used as a lampshade with a floor lamp OR as an installed fixture. And I'm sure the kit would have worked fine BUT it didn't include a cap, so when we removed the old fixture and tried to put this one in, that meant there was a big hole in the ceiling where the old ugly cap was! So we went to Lowe's and got a cap, installed it along with their wiring kit, and I couldn't be happier with it.",4.0
