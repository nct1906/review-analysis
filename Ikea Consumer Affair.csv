"Laura of Palmdale., CA","Original review: Dec. 3, 2020",I love Ikea designs. I don't like that much that you have to put together the furniture. If you are going to sell me half of the job done ✅ you should charge me half of the price. And the delivery is on me too? What are these people doing? They have all profits no costs? Really? How we arrive to this place? I think everything is overpriced if you consider you are putting the furniture together. They only sell you the plans and the raw material. They don't even cover the cost of the delivery. And the furniture is not such a good quality to justify the price but yes I love the design. Another bad point for this chain at least where I've been that was somewhere in S.F Valley in L.A. inside a mall. It took us forever the line to pay. There was too many people not enough cashiers.,4.0
"Joyce of Bellmore, NY","Original review: Nov. 28, 2020","Most of our furniture is from Ikea and I assembled it also. I am a small lady and I felt great being able to assemble it myself! I love the different smooth finishes of the wood furniture, and the clean lines. They do not go out of style. I gave the rating a 4 star because I have not seen sofas that I like a lot. Our sofas are from another source. I also love that you can find so many uniquely good looking & practical small items for your home while you may be looking for furniture. They have it all: lighting, rugs, pictures, frames, pots (love them) & pans, etc. I particularly love the children's department. It's filled with very cute furniture & wonderful unique toys at a low price.",4.0
"Lucian of Windsor, ON","Original review: Nov. 27, 2020","Very practical furniture but not always for a long term perspective for usage. What I meant is that quality of the materials used in making it not so good. And I have to remark the ingenuity of the designers from IKEA. They are one of the best in the whole world and in the same time this is reflected into the price that it is kind of high for some of the items they sell. Very nice stores and very ""direct"" and they are not for the customer that comes just to ""browse"" because got bored with the furniture he already has. Clean and very shiny from the lights they used all around their furniture. Like they say, the better the looks the faster the sale!!!",4.0
"Jackie of North Haven, CT","Original review: Nov. 25, 2020","I use the one in New Haven, CT. It is very large and is fun to walk around. I don't typically buy any of the food from the dining area but I have bought food from here before. Some of my favorite pieces of furniture have been from IKEA. I'm not crazy about their couches, though or mattresses. I have bought bed frames, bedside tables, dressers and plenty of other household items from here. I absolutely LOVE assembling their products and I have never had any issues. Anything I have bought from here has lasted me forever.",5.0
"Giedrius of Brooklyn, NY","Original review: Nov. 24, 2020","I love that Ikea creating displays looking like real living places. I think it's genius idea, instead just slopping furniture in huge showroom. What Ikea does, it makes these cozy living like nooks, that looks like real living space. That allows me to see actual size of the furniture. I had bought sofa- bed at Raymour and Flanigan Outlet probably 7 years ago, in showroom it looked normal size, but when it got delivered, it looked to bulky in my living-room. Yes, measuring will help, but visual display the way Ikea does, very helpful as well. Just do not go to Ikea on weekends, it's a zoo.",4.0

"cecilia of West Berlin, NJ","Original review: Oct. 23, 2021","I had a horrible customer service experience with IKEA. I ordered the MALM dresser which was shipped to my house (I paid for delivery of the item). Once received I realized that one of the boxes including the parts to put the dresser together was a duplicate box, meaning there are 3 boxes (of parts) for the dresser #1, 2, & 3. I received 1,1,3 no #2 box. Basically Ikea sent me the wrong box of parts. I called their customer service line and spoke to Miranda and her supervisor Sherron, who informed that even though IKEA made the mistake, that I would have to personally drive to an IKEA store to return the item or get the correct box of parts.

I should never have had to jump through such hoops to get assistance. Here's the complaint: IKEA refuses to refund 4 items I returned as per THEIR return instructions via FedEx. I can prove the items shipped (see attachments). I called twice and spent numerous hours trying to reason with IKEA, but they were of no assistance and told me to contact FedEx. I wasted more time contacting FedEx, but of course, they denied the claim, because IKEA has an agreement to not file claims (also attached). It is APPALLING that a company like IKEA treats customers with such disrespect. They obviously know that I could NEVER recoup the refund for the returned items through FedEx. I have wasted several hours for absolutely nothing! I generally love IKEA products, but their customer service has been terrible.",1.0
"Maria of Elizabeth, NJ","Original review: Oct. 9, 2021","I purchased a Cylinder Glass Vase from IKEA & it arrived to my home TOTALLY SHATTERED. First of all, there was absolutely NOTHING on the box to indicate the contents are ""FRAGILE"". Second, the glass vase WAS PACKED WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF PROTECTIVE MATERIAL to protect the vase from being damaged while being handled & while in transit. There was only ONE PIECE OF SHRIVELED UP BROWN PAPER in the packing box. The vase was just placed in one box & then packed in ANOTHER box with one piece of shriveled up brown paper, NO protective material & sealed with ONE WEAK PIECE OF TAPE. How STUPID to pack a GLASS VASE like this??? IKEA obviously didn't give ONE DAMN if my item got damaged.

"Denise of Alexandria, VA","Original review: Oct. 6, 2021","My kitchen project cost 6000 and the main reason I used IKEA was to use the financing credit card. They provided good service helping me design the kitchen but as soon as that part os over the nightmare began. I needed a 5 thousand purchase to fall in the 24 months bracket and my first order was 4920.00. This is because they failed to tell me that I would not find everything on the first day I ordered. I had to place about 8 other orders to get everything and go from store to store (VA and MD) picking up stuff plus a few Fedex stores to get the parts and not pay $50 for each delivery or because some parts could not be delivered for whatever reason. Not even store pickup was available because the ""stock was low"". So I had to travel from these 2 stores as quickly as possible before anyone got there??!!... There is no help after you buy. ",1.0

If you're (IKEA) trying to copy Amazon with respect to delivery, at least have a track of where the product is and when it will be delivered. Fooling the customer by changing and delaying delivery date (3 days, 5 days then 20 days) repeatedly. Only a ""helpline"" number whose receiver can do nothing but say ""We are very Sorry Sir"".

I return an item for 12 dollars on day 93 ... they refused to give me back what I had paid ... I got a card, and had to waste my time get some junk for $5 since there was nothing else had any need or desire for. This was about 4 years ago. I just found the card and threw it out. I used to spend over $300 a year at IKEA for several years but have never gone back because of this incident. They do not have many convenient locations either. A normal business would take into consideration the amount of a refund and how many days over some specified time is involved ... the gist being to retain customers, a policy which IKEA has proven to NOT be something they care about.",2.0

There is no chat option, and email is restricted to ONE possible subject, canceling an order. Are they serious? IKEA are a major company and I've purchased from them for 30 years in two continents. They really need to shake things up with the basic information they share with the public. I'm afraid I'm giving up and moving on.",1.0
"Kimberly of Washington, DC","Original review: Sept. 14, 2020","I purchased an Ikea Farlov Sectional Sofa and the order and delivery were smooth. The sofa however is terrible quality. The back cushions are thinner than throw pillows and you can feel the frame against your back. Ikea has a 365 day return policy, and we'd like to return the sofa right away. Problem is as soon as you call Ikea and click through all the options - they say they aren't taking calls. There is no way to get ahold of them to have your return processed. We also ordered dining chairs that say they were 18 inches seat height. They're 20-21 seat height and SO uncomfortable. The upholstery quality in Ikea has gone downhill considerably just in the past 5 years since our last purchases. We're so disappointed that we spent a few thousand dollars on furniture that we just want to throw out.",1.0

The Kallax Shelf arrived with a smash through one of the boxes and into the product, leaving a gaping hole in one of the shelves.

"Kelly of Spirit Lake, IA","Original review: June 25, 2020","Placed an online order for delivery end of April as couldn’t get a spot for store pickup. Order placed, credit card charged, delivery date came and went. Couldn’t reach IKEA, disconnected from customer service line every time I called, finally reached someone and they said they didn’t know when it would be delivered...so cancelled, but they wouldn’t refund the interest accrued on an IKEA credit card. Not even for store credit. So I paid $30 to be inconvenienced by an order that never arrived and was very difficult to cancel and get a refund. These items were for a rental business so it’s important that the items or the refund were received in a timely manner, which they weren’t. Wondering if a refund will even be issued as they said it takes 7-14 days. Reported to BBB and AG.",1.0

Waiting a month wasn't ideal but I took it. The delivery day came and went. No e-mail, no call. When I go to Ikea.com and enter my order it shows only the placement date. When you call the 1-888 number they don't let you reschedule your orders nor do you get any operator. They must have laid all employees off. I paid $700 without no delivery, no way to contact the store. Worst experience ever. I shop since 1990 at Ikea, after 30 years they finally upset me.

I am bruised; not seriously. PLEASE make sure when hanging a shelf find the studding and secure solidly with a screw into that stud. DO NOT rely on the wallboard hanger to HOLD the self securely.

I received 2 boxes, one with the table top, and one with the metal frame and screws, etc. When I received them both of the boxes had holes in them. The one with the metal frame and screws, etc. was wide open at the top. The plastic bag inside with all the screws also had a hole in it and about half of them were scattered around the box. Luckily none of the parts I received were damaged, but I am missing 2 small parts: one of the 102696 pieces, and one of the flat 141257 pieces. They must have fallen out through the wide open top of the box.",1.0
"Tamas of Rochester, MI","Original review: Sept. 11, 2019","Worst Customer Service and Home Delivery - at the same time. I ordered some furniture on August 14, and due to the issues with the delivery department, I still have not received them (it's is Sept 11 today). I tried to call the Customer Service. First, they forwarded my call to another department, where I got the message ""Sorry, we are receiving high call volume now"" and the line got disconnected. After that, I tried to call them again, and could not even get to a person. I have been waiting for my delivery for almost a month. I feel like IKEA stole my money, as they took the money right away, and did not give anything in return - I consider this stealing. If you are thinking about getting something delivered from IKEA, do yourself a favor and just don't. If you can go there and pick it up by yourself, do that, otherwise look elsewhere for your furniture.",1.0
"Sharon of Durham, NC","Original review: Sept. 9, 2019","Although IKEA may provide home furnishings that are within budget, if anything goes wrong with the order, good luck getting in touch with them. Wait times are over 60 minutes on the phone, but don't worry about waiting, the telephone message system will just tell you they are too busy to take your call and hang up on you. Trying to email? Unless your issue fits on one of their ""form emails,"" you will be unsuccessful at getting service. I am shocked by people saying they had to call upwards of 10 and 15 times to get service, then still giving IKEA 4 stars. No! I am trying to return to them something I did NOT order, and there does not appear to be any possibility of that happening. I have called (and been hung up on 2X), I have emailed 2X.

"Nicholas of Sidney, OH","Original review: Sept. 9, 2019","Tried to make an online IKEA order during one of their sales. I kept getting a generic data transfer error. I sent an email and gave up figuring I would figure it out the next day either by a response to the email or by calling them. So far I have not gotten an email response, so I tried calling. Most of the calls don't go through and it says that there is a larger than normal volume of calls so good luck try again later. When I finally got through to someone we went back and forth for awhile. She gave her thought on what these general errors MIGHT have been. She finally said she would forward me to another department that might be able to help. Then when I was forwarded I again got the recording that there are too many calls and to try some other time. So their website throws errors, and it's just about impossible to get ahold of anyone to even figure out what can be done.",1.0

This is a big mistake unless you hire them to do it all for you. They have a great sales and design process and are willing to help you plan your kitchen. I wish I had know what a monumental pain it is to assemble and install one of these kitchens. Our contractor led us to believe that it would be no problem.

The 3 problems encountered were: (1) missing baseboard in storage compartment (2) one side arm fit poorly - had to be forced down and now can't be removed to adjust cover, (3) IKEA-USA apparently does not stock mattress cover and sheets in European sizes to fit this sofa bed. I tried phoning IKEA at 888-888-4532 multiple times to report the missing part. Every time the recorded message said the phone lines were busy and hung up.",1.0

So if you have a defect in your kitchen cabinets they can't replace any parts for them under warranty. Leaving the customer with no recourse. The case can go to a Resolution Team that is hell bent NOT TO PAY YOU the fair amount that is supposed to be covered under warranty. The company knew this line had a lot of defects and discounted the cabinets and under false pretense and is not able to make replacement parts on the cabinets! If you do fight this Ikea has hired a 3rd party company to come to your home and evaluate the damage.,1.0

S. of Canada,"Original review: Dec. 9, 2018","I'd purchased this sofa bed from Ikea that looks promising, online and in store. We bought the sofa for 799+ tax, paid 100$ for delivery and 100$ for assembly. Guess what, after paying 1100$ for the damn sofa bed, it fell apart in less than a month after purchase. The screw came right off and it won't assemble back. Fine, the product was damaged or the quality was bad, whatever, a few months later we decide to call the customer service, who advised that unless we have the receipt, we can't return it or exchange it. Understandable still, I'd say it's pretty reasonable. ",1.0

Still waiting on a $1300 refund a month later 9/28 because they processed the order incorrectly...didn't initiate a partial refund because their accounting and phone staff are lobotomized. Get ready to be left on hold for hours, make the same call a dozen times to find out your refund has not been processed. Oh and when they say they pushed this to their manager or put your refund on the RID list to expedite your refund...they're lying...they don't know how to do that. ",1.0
"Scott of Columbia, SC","Original review: Sept. 28, 2018","I love IKEA products, and don't even mind the gargantuan stores. Always chow down on some Swedish meatballs and take some sweet rolls home. I've bought numerous items there, large and small. Assembly has always been precise, never a missing part, and durability has been better than expected even with items I bought for the kids room. So this time decided to buy office shelving and a couple of large wardrobes and have them delivered. In the end, about $6k worth, so not a small purchase by IKEA standards. Ordering process a bit tedious navigating all the options and such but got it done without too much hassle. THAT'S WHERE THE GOOD EXPERIENCE ENDED! So the first thing after I order is notification that it is going to be 20 days before my scheduled delivery. ",1.0

On that date, IKEA delivered 2 bed frames, 1 dresser, but NOT the 2 mattresses to go on the beds. Delivery company took note of this but said we had to contact IKEA ourselves about it. After 2-3 hours on hold, we reached customer service who said they call us next day to set up new delivery date. Heard nothing for days. Finally went online and found they’d scheduled delivery for August 14, I.e. 2 weeks later. Again, multiple attempts to reach customer service. Finally did, and decided to cancel order and buy mattresses elsewhere. We were told that they’d refund credit card within 7 days (ridiculous enough; credits should be processed within 1-2 days).",1.0

The inducement to give up on any attempt to do anything except purchase new product is characteristic of a bad company. After 76 minutes on hold they hung up on me.

I know IKEA is cheapo furniture, so I never had any illusions about the quality of its products. I viewed it realistically. However, over the years when I need some little piece of furniture that needed to be inexpensive I went to the store and bought what they had in stock. Never had problem or thought anything was out of sorts. I was the ideal IKEA customer, I walked the store, bought what they had, paid attention to how many boxes each piece had, didn't need help, and never had an issue.",1.0

They did not and it’s still on my credit card. Have called at least 5 times and waited between 45 and 90 minutes to get someone on the phone. Each time they said it would be taken care of. Today.

I am having the exact same issue as everyone here. Shipment not arriving as promised with the inability to get in touch with IKEA since their phone lines are always busy (>45mins wait). I decided to escalate the situation. I found a random email for the IKEA franchising company in Europe and emailed them explaining the situation (even though I live in Virginia). They replied immediately and forwarded it to the head of US customer relations, who also replied saying that my shipment is delayed and that they are willing to waive the shipment fees to make up for it. It’s very crazy that I had to email some random person in Europe that has nothing to do with this in order to get my voice heard. I will be updating this post once I find out more. According to this thread this has happened way too frequently and we should not have to resort to this.",3.0

"Lauren of Kettering, OH","Original review: May 7, 2018",Please do yourself a favor and never order online with IKEA. What a joke. So I ordered five small things from their website two weeks ago and I'm just now had four things delivered to my doorway past the expected delivery date. I had to call several times to check up on it. And you have to wait on hold forever to get a hold of a customer service person and every single customer person that I spoke to was so unbelievably rude. I don't even know how they still have a job. Then I finally do get my packages and the most expensive thing I ordered was missing. So I called and The incredibly rude lady on the phone tells me that it's going to be another two weeks before they can even send it out again!!! Please do yourself a favor and never order from this crappy crappy company.,1.0
"Mia of Allyn, WA","Original review: May 6, 2018",If I could give a zero I would. I thought I could do business with this company online since I’ve never had an issue at their stores. I wanted to cancel an order just about 2 hours after making the order online. So I emailed them after being on the phone on hold for an hour. But it says it will not get back to you for 5 days. Well I then called being placed on hold for hours every time. I still have never got an answer. My order says it will be processed soon. But I have passed the date it was supposed to be delivered. Still no answer. Their customers service is non existent. I cannot believe they are allowed to treat customers like this. I’ve literally spent hours and hours with no help. I also tried to get a response on their Facebook page and they were responding but when I asked them why my order was never delivered they just stopped responding and are ignoring my messages now. If they weren’t so well known I would think this is a scam!,1.0
"Karen of Richmond Hill, GA","Original review: May 4, 2018","I placed an order on 3/29 which was to be delivered on 4/4 and never came. I canceled the order and was told it would take 14 days for a refund (unfortunately I used a debit card). 14 days later still no refund so I called and they said something had happened and the order wasn't canceled so they had to redo the cancellation. Again another 14 days to wait on the refund. Each time you call - there is at least a 45-60 minute wait. So today I call again - waited 45 minutes - finally spoke to a lady - the credit had not been processed. It would take at least another 5-7 days to process. I finally ask for a manager and told them, ""No I wanted a refund today."" The best that they could do is try and walk it through but it would be Monday before it would go through. They said the problem was all the recalls they are having has put them about 2 months behind. I never received any item from Ikea and they are holding on to my $500.",1.0

During assembly, noticed that the ""cam locks"" were no longer metal, but were white plastic. The obvious occurred and one of the ""cam locks"" broke. IKEA does not include ""extra"" plastic cam locks. I suppose that would defeat the purpose of their cost savings initiative to replace a reliable component with a ""CHEAPER"" plastic replica.

If you want to shop at Ikea AVOID DELIVERY AND ASSEMBLY. I am embarrassed to say that I ordered 7 large pieces. Because of the size of the order I had no choice and had to do a delivery and ultimately decided to do the assembly also. Each piece had a delivery and assembly charge, which is understandable. On the initial delivery there was nothing correct of the 7 pieces. The tv stand did not have the framework. The whole custom wardrobe did not have the doors. The bookcases were all missing pieces and the dining room table was brown instead of black.

Unfortunately, my story echoes many of those shared here. It took several weeks (about 7 total) and multiple phone calls with waiting times of at LEAST 45 minutes, to receive my order. Half of the order was shipped after a long wait, and the 2nd half (the actual sofa of the sofa order; the first half contained the footstool and the sofa cover) came after Christmas, for an order placed on November 2, 2017. I would not recommend using Ikea online ordering to anyone. Let's face it - Ikea is great, but they are not in anyway structured to handle shipping, much less FREE shipping.

I had to pay in a different department because the printer on the floor was broken that trigger a series of delay like the base was stored too high and a special forklift was needed it and for security concern could not operate while store is open so I had to pick up the chair the day after the helpful manager that give to me at my question, ""This the wrong chair, has no wheel."" He had me convince that the wheel will be inside the base box only to my disappointment at home to have pick up the wrong item without the wheel; too busy, too superficial, too stupid. Don't know.

The mattress is claimed to be 100% Latex (85% natural15% synthetic) medium firm. The mattress was much firmer than expected but was told it would take time to soften up since latex is more dense. We had 2 toppers during the 2 years we have had it. The mattress also smells like a barnyard. Looking at the label our mattress is 87% latex 13% wool (from the label). Is that why it is so hard, maybe. It has also never soften up as we were told it would. So we thought we ended up with a defective product.",1.0

I asked her how much it cost & she did not look it up. She kept telling me it was part of a set & need a barcode. The whole time I was shopping at this store location I saw this exact same item placed all over the store in different locations. It was not advertised in any way shape or form as being part of set & I only wanted to buy one. The lady on register was very rude to me. I just smiled & walked away after nicely telling her I will just go & buy the exact item from a different store. She did not even bother to get assistance from a manager or anything. The whole experience made me feel disvalued as one of your customer. Very unprofessional & not at all how you treat a customer.,1.0

When delivered on May 25th the delivery company STI refused to take the 5 boxes they left last time and added the 6 boxes of a replaced bed, because they did not have the paperwork. Guess what!!! The same box was damaged again but not the piece inside, so we decided to keep it. ",1.0

You have to purchase new cabinet and refuse the one you order when they deliver in 2 weeks."" The customer service at the store told me they did not care about what the call center told me, most of the time they do not know what is happening at the store.

"Ken of St. Louis, MO","Original review: Aug. 15, 2016",I have assembled several modular furniture units over the years with very few problems (if any at all). This weekend I made a trip to the St. Louis IKEA store to look for a wardrobe storage unit. I found a unit that would work for my storage purposes and also found a small table with cubed storage. I bought both of these items. Decided to assemble the small table before tackling the wardrobe. The assembly was horrible. The dowels and the locking screws did not match up when joining the various pieces. I fought the assembly for several hours (hard to believe). I wound up taking all the dowels out just to join the sides to the bottom and shelves. I still have not been able to assemble the top. I plan on returning the wardrobe and NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM IKEA again.,2.0

Do not order online from Ikea and accept the default 'ground delivery' unless you enjoy being robbed by two corporate giants, or if you are a pure existentialist who accepts a completely random universe. To enjoy the FedEx ""service"" that Ikea will charge you for (a service which is not only NOT ""guaranteed"" but for which you will be charged and cannot be refunded even if you cancel the original order), you must be willing and able to wait outside FOR 12 HOURS PER DAY OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL DAYS, in the hopes that a FedEx delivery truck may randomly appear, as there will be NO RELIABLE INDICATION OF WHAT DAY OR TIME THE DELIVERY may occur. I think they have a more expensive (and possibly less ineffective) delivery option, but I did not know that. My mistake was to choose the default ""ground shipping."" ",1.0

There is no way you can directly call to the store. There is no number for the customer support as well. Using google we found one. We called and after 1 hour on the phone, detailed investigation by the manger we were promised to have somebody call us from the store, and mail us the shelves. Obviously we will pay for them. We agreed. (Even the tv stand on the floor in Ikea had the shelves, and the picture did have the shelves as well when we were buying the product. We decided it's not worth it to argue with them any more.)",1.0

In my opinion, IKEA is a bad business model for the U.S. market. The customer service is anything but. Here is my experience: First and last shopping experience at this wanna-be furniture store. IKEA is ANYTHING but furniture. DIY? Yes. Cheaply made items? Yes. I feel like I've been through the worst customer service nightmare from which I couldn't wake up! Drove from Central Ca. to the closest store in East Palo Alto CA to get a bed and mattress for our grandchild. With no previous IKEA experience, we asked the young salesman if there were ANY other parts not included in the frame package. ""No. You have everything you need"" was his answer. Boom baby! We did it. Out of the store in only 2.5 hours... NOT SO FAST! Purgatory never ends!!!",1.0

I called them for the first time (15 min in queue) and they said that would contact the delivery company to check if they had the box. Never heard back so I called again (20+ min in queue) and then the lady said she would put me on hold and get an update for the delivery company. Bottom line: They were not able to locate the missing box and the solution was to delivery everything again, and I should once take the missing box and reject the other ones. At this point I was fine with the resolution since issues happen and they had a good resolution for it.",1.0

They was also down to one drawer left that was damaged and had missing parts and she also placed the wrong product number on one of our items causing more confusion, for we depend on the IKEA employees to be competent enough to complete an accurate design to make a smooth experience in the self serve. We also had to wait an hour to pick up a mirror door. Mirror doors are not in the self serve due to likelihood of being damaged. I concluded that IKEA is too cheap to package the mirrored doors properly so that customers are not inconvenienced even further by having to wait another hour to pick up through customer service.

Wayfair.com is a much better company that has just as good quality and better customer service.

During assembly the bottom wasn't tied up to the upper part (as it should have been), and with time the thing deformed badly and space opened wide between the parts.

As this is a clear case of negligence by IKEA provided contractor, I requested replacement, along with delivery and assembly. IKEA rejected the claim, because it was more than 90 days since purchasing and the only way is to bring this thing back, where they would inspect it and issue the verdict.

I stupidly reordered since I was told there were now 18 in the warehouse. I was given the delivery date of 8/26.

It was stated in the store that the push-button door openers were optional and sold separately, but nowhere were the hinges mentioned. Quite upset, (what are we going to do with hingeless doors? ) I stopped and resolved to return to Ikea. When I did, I had to argue with the customer service woman that nowhere in my packages were the hinges included, and after a fair deal of time, she gave the hinges free of charge (pretty nice). At home, I discovered she had given me an incorrect part of the hinge. Not her fault- probably just a mistake- but still meant that I couldn't attach one of the doors.",2.0

I was told to perhaps visit an Ikea and search there. Really? The nearest store is now 3 hours away from me. A six hour trip for 8 bolts? ",1.0

We never experienced such a rudeness and unwillingness to help as we did today. It was not the Ikea's bad experience, but the customer care from one particular individual who made me very upset and angry. We created a shopping list of all items to be picked up in the self-serve area. The first item, according to the printed paper was in the Aisle 01, bin 8. There were no items in that section, even in the bin 9. I went to the help kiosk to get some guidance on where to locate the items. ",2.0

Parking was easy but that's where it stopped. Once inside you are directed around by arrows on the floor with no way to get out except to complete the path. Narrow isles cluttered with packing materials. Shelves in disarray with product scattered about so as to make it impossible to match items with the shelf tags.

I remembered how flimsy some of the cabinets felt when I bought them for a 90's kitchen and the backings are still the same.

I took a cab to the store as I didn't want to order online due to the long delivery time as I wanted to have everything assembled before the weekend. The home delivery company arrived and they were really professional, but once they tried to assemble my Stolmen system they notice that one of the poles were malfunctioning and you couldn't use it. The home delivery company briefed me about what to do and I called the IKEA's customer service where they told me that I could expect to have everything fixed by Monday the latest (this was on Friday evening).

No amount of lower prices is balanced out by finding myself TWENTIETH in a check out or return line. The individual staff are average - helpful, a few are delights, but by and large they don't know the detailed answers (what doors fit my Billy bookcase?) and there is clearly NO incentive nor training to do better - or to bring another cashier up when three lines are open on a busiest Saturday of the month.

Could not have been more wrong. The measuring team was out of their league - only to be discovered much later and at great expense.... They placed a fridge over an electric panel, they made cupboards too low, and chose the wrong faucet (that didn't fit). Delivery was a disaster with pieces missing that Ikea refused to replace. Finally, the installer (Traemand) came, installed and left us with gaps, mismatched counter tops, a huge scratch on the new oven, and so much more I can't bore you with the details. Of course calls are not returned and you can't find any satisfactory complaint reviews at Ikea. Forget it.

"Jeff of Silverthorne, CO","Original review: June 14, 2014","We set up a ""pick and deliver"" through Ikea one week prior to the delivery. We spent over 6 hours in the Ikea store selecting the exact products. Upon delivery, we had wrong products, damaged products, and missing products. Now we have spent MANY hours on the phone (minimum of a 45 min hold time), many hours at the store with Customer Service (2 hours) exchanging, returning, and trying to pick up merchandise. After being promised a FedEx delivery of our final missing furniture, we have not received any merchandise, have not received any tracking numbers, and from one person at Ikea to the next, nobody knows how to ""truly"" fix the problems. IF you were to ever choose Pick and Deliver, I would be sure to have your order ready upon receipt of the items and carefully inventory your order.

We bought the Fjell queen bed. It came in 3 separate boxes and was over 1000 pieces... if I'm lyin', I'm dyin' - 1000 PIECES!!! It took an entire day to assemble. The instructions were difficult to read and several pages had no references to part numbers so we had to guess. Not to mention, once this thing is built, it is virtually impossible to move because there's nuts and bolts everywhere. It's definitely not one of those type of beds where you can just slide the rails off and go. Oh yeah, none of the parts are numbered making even more of a time waster. Not even close to being worth it, in my humble opinion. IKEA does have some cool stuff, accessories and whatnot but I will NEVER buy another piece of large furniture from them again.

I took extra care to assemble the unit and looked at all the instructions before even beginning to assemble it. I'm very experienced at assembling all kinds of furniture. This one appeared to be very easy, but my concern was the quality of the material (the frame). It is made out of particle board (pressed wood), but very bad quality. When I was just about to finish the unit and me and my wife attempted to move carefully, the whole thing went into pieces and broke beyond believe. I had to toss it in the garbage.

Being a US business school graduate and I am teaching financial management at the local business school, I consider myself an enlightened customer. That is why I observe with disdain how  international companies (from City Group to OBI) lower their standards of services in Russian province to the level of their local competitors. Generally, it does not take them much time. However, there were two notable exemptions: McDonalds and IKEA, who, in my view, managed until recently to preserve the Western quality of services.

On Friday, August 28th, I purchased about $250 worth of items, including 6 folding plastic chairs and 6 black seat cushions to go with them. When I came home, I set up the chairs and put one of the cushions on one of the chairs. At this point, I decided I didn’t need the cushions and I placed them in my car for return to the store. When I returned to the store three days later, on Monday, August 31st, the customer service representative commented on the lint on the cushions and asked if I had used them. I told her no. She then called over another representative to point out what she called a stain on the cushion. ",
"Holley of Rowlett, TX","Original review: Aug. 25, 2009","Within the last year, I purchased a Vika Glasholm (glass desktop) from the Ikea store in Frisco, Tx. Yesterday, we came home from my daughter's 1st day of high school to find it had exploded into a million glass pieces. The only thing that was on the desk when she left was a pile of clean clothes and her makeup. I found small and large pieces of glass under the door, under the bed, on top of the bed and across the room. I will probably find glass shards for years. Thank God nobody was in the room when it happened. After doing a little searching on the web this morning, I am shocked to see that this has happened to some of other Ikea customers (not the same tabletop but other glass products). I do not remember seeing any warnings on the box or in any of the paperwork. I hope that you address this very serious situation.",

"Angela of San Jose, CA","Original review: July 10, 2009","I researched a product online (LOTS 4 pack 12"" mirrors) and found them at IKEA for $4.99 per pack. I went to the store to purchase them because it stated online that this item is not available for purchase online. At the store, the listed price was $9.99 (double the price). I purchased them anyway thinking that they would give me a price adjustment, but they did not. They stated there is a disclaimer online which states that the actual prices may be different in the store. So, they advertise it at $4.99, tell you that you can only purchase at the store, but then they tell you each store can set their own price. Then why are they advertising any price online? When I spoke to customer care, they stood by their ""online disclaimer"" and wouldn't let me speak to a supervisor and said I had to go into the store to speak to a manager. When I asked how to get the $4.99 price, they said I would have to shop at other stores to see if they carried at that price. The closest store to me is this one which is already 20 miles away and I refuse to have to go further!",

Needless to say, I felt this was extortion and the situation elevated to the point where some man physically tried to kick me out of the store.

When I arrive all the children were huddled on staircase in playcenter (my son Reagan too) but my Robert, age 5, was laying on bathroom floor - bloody with the lady holding his wounded and very bloody frontal lobe.",

"Mike of Santa Fe, NM","Original review: May 29, 2007","I ordered 3 medicine cabinets.  The products, which were very fragile, were not properly shipped, they were simply wrapped in thin cardboard without any attempt to provide boxing to prevent breakage.  All three cabinets arrived with all glass components in hundreds of pieces and the metal frames were all bent.   My 5 year old niece could have done a better job preparing theses items for shipping. It would appear to me that Ikea really did not want to see these units arrive intact; they did every thing necessary to insure that the items would arrive broken. ",

Went to the store to return door handles not used. The clerk was rude, the manager was rude and the assistant store manager was even ruder. All in all if I never see or hear about another IKEA as long as I live it would make me a happy man. The parking lot alone was a 20 minute ordeal then in the store waiting for help took 30 minutes only to be roadblocked and stuck with a store credit that I will never use.",

France from Ikea Bordeaux, using English speaking service. Arranged to visit our home in France for 1 week at beginning of April 2007 to receive these goods. They arrived on the Tuesday, 1 large, expensive( to us ) sofa short. My wife contacted Ikea France who said they would contact delivery company and call us back, they didn't.

"Lisa of Bayside, NY","Original review: Oct. 13, 2006","On Oct 3rd, I ordered a chair and ottoman from Ikea's website for $120.98 and shipping $31.58.  The website says an email confirmation will be sent in 24 hours.  When I didn't get one, I emailed to inquire about the order.  No response.  So the next day I emailed to cancel the order.  One Oct 10th, I received an email confirmation of the order with instructions on phoning to cancel.  I called and was placed on hold for a solid hour until I finally hung up.  I have not been able to cancel the order.",
"Paul of 178 Dalmeny Road, NY","Original review: May 1, 2006","On Janaury 16, 2006 I placed an internet order with IKEA for an ""ANEBODA"" model bed, article #S59825491, for a price of $119.00.  I understood at the time of the order that the price did not include delivery but that IKEA would contact me within 5-7 business to provide the exact total cost.  The order I placed was for delivery to my daughter in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Afetr three weeks I made my first call to inquire about the status of the order.  After a couple of calls I was finally quoted a price of $180 for the delivery by truck.  I provided my approval.  ",

"Anand of Jersey City, NJ","Original review: Feb. 26, 2006","IKEA advertises that foam mattresses are supplied as ""rolled"" packed. I bought one FOAM mattress (fangebo/king) on 02/22/06 and first checked on website and then cross checked with booking agent in mattress section(jessica) if it is ""rolled-packed"" and got a positive answer. Made the payments and upon collecting noticed that it was not ""rolled-packed"". They kept blaming on each other and there was no floor manager to sort this out. They suggested me to collect the delivery and go to ""returns"" to give it back. I needed to pick the mattress myself in my car (to accomodate my newborn who came 02/07) and so was looking for a prerolled one. ",

I then called IKEA and was told that there was some problems with the truck and the delivery would be delayed but it would come eventually by the end of the day.That was why I kept waiting for the truck til 7:30pm.I did not see any truck come by at all.",
"Ben of Londo, LONDON","Original review: March 29, 2001",An IKEA moulded plastic chair (non self-assembly product) collapsed causing fracture to my wrist. This subseqently needed surgery to rectify the problem but to no avail. IKEA do not claim responsibility for the injuries caused by the chair. I live in the UK and its very different here -- I dont know what to do and which law firm to contact.,
